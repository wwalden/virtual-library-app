# Collectio App

# Description
  Collectio is an app allowing you to collect different medias you like (movies, series, books...) and store them in one place.
  This is a school project I worked on with 3 coworkers, practicing Git and Agile method.
  The back-end part of the code (this repo) is the part I worked on.

# Installation
  `npm install`
  `npm run dev`
  
  Or ask me for Heroku direct access.

# Usage
  You can use Register and Login functions (User CRUD), then add medias to your library (Media CRUD).
